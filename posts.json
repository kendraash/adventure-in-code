  "text": "Handlebars. Handlebars everywhere. You would think life in Portland would have prepared her for runaway facial hair. It didn't. Handlebars were hard to grasp.

Not to worry! We can do it! Kendra and Rachael had little idea what they were in for, but went anyways. It was hard, but in the end they can say that they did it. And did it well.",
